# Seminar Cryptocurrency Modelling

This code is for modelling the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) future curve. It involves six trading trading strategies to profit based on the theoretical no-arbitrage future price, after being corrected for deviations for it via correcting features such as average liquidity, average price, average spread and an indicator function. 

This project was under supervision of Maverick Derrivatives. For details, feel free to download the pdf in the map.
