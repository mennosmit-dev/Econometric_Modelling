# 📊 Econometric Coding
Welcome to this repository cointaining a small subset of my code from various econometric projects. ! 🚀

### 🛠️ Overview

- 🐍 **Python Projects**  
  Most projects are implemented in **Python**, following the [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for clean and readable code.

- 🧮 **NLO Project**  
  Written in **MATLAB**, adhering to the [MathWorks MATLAB Style Guidelines](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0).

- ☕ **DataFrame Project**  
  Developed in **Java**, following [Oracle's Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html).

### 📁 A few ML projects:
- `Egalitarian_Lasso`: forecast combinations with Egalitarian Lasso
- `IncomePredictingRandomForest`: income Prediction with random forest
- `Optimising_Nonlinear_Function`: custom batch gradient descent
- `Thesis_Nowcast`: applying nonlinear mixed-frequency PCA
