# Econometric Coding
This repository contains a small subset of my code from various econometric projects. 

- Most projects are implemented in **Python**, following the [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- The **NLO** project is written in **MATLAB**, adhering to [MathWorks MATLAB Style Guidelines](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46056-matlab-style-guidelines-2-0).
- The **DataFrame** project is developed in **Java**, following [Oracle's Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html).

Besides these I also have experience in R, AIMMS, and EVIEWS.
