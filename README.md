# Econometric Modeling & Quantitative Projects

This repository contains selected econometric and quantitative modeling projects 
covering forecasting, regularization techniques, optimization, and financial modeling.

The focus is on rigorous statistical modeling combined with modern machine learning 
techniques for applied economic and financial problems.

## 🧠 Overview

Core themes explored:

- Penalized regression & forecast combinations
- Tree-based machine learning models
- Optimization algorithms
- Mixed-frequency time series modeling
- Financial forecasting and trading strategy design

Most projects are implemented in **Python**, with additional work in MATLAB and Java 
for specialized modeling tasks.
