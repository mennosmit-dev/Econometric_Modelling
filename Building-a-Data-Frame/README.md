# Building a Data Frame

This class generates a dataFrame in Java, comprimising a DataFrame and DataVector, using different data structures like linkedHashMaps. In addition it contains several tools to analyze data, ranging from statistical tests, correlation estimation and the estimation of a linear model. It builds on several known classes for data manipulation.

Although I have extensive programming experience in Java, which I gained through bi-weekly practical projects in 'Introduction to Programming' and 'Programming' which focused on object-orientated programming, ost of these projects I cannot find in memory anymore.
