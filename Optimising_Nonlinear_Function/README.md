# Lagrangian Relaxation for Set Covering Problem

This repository provides MATLAB functions to solve the **set covering problem** using **Lagrangian relaxation** and **subgradient optimization**.

## üìñ Overview

The code implements:

- **CalculateLagrangian:** Computes the Lagrangian relaxation‚Äôs objective and solution for given multipliers.
- **ComputeNextLambda:** Updates Lagrangian multipliers via a subgradient step.
- **ConvertInfeasToFeas:** Converts infeasible primal solutions into feasible ones with a greedy heuristic.
- **PerformSubgradientOptimization:** Runs the overall subgradient optimization algorithm to improve bounds iteratively.

## üîç Problem Description

The **set covering problem** aims to select a subset of "routes" (or sets) to cover all "customers" (or elements), minimizing total cost. Lagrangian relaxation allows handling difficult constraints by incorporating them into the objective with multipliers.
