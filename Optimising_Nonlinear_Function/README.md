# Nonlinear Optimisation

This program contains a series of functions to optimise convex nonlinear functions including a step function which determines the optimal step-length, a step direction which is the optimal direction within the parameter space (tried SGD and other methods).

Although I have extensive programming experience in MATLAB, which I gained through practical projects in Combinitorial Optimisation and dedicated theory (and others such as Seminar focused on operations research), I lost of these projects I cannot find in memory anymore.
